"""
KrishiSahayak Scripts Package.

This directory contains executable scripts that serve as entry points for the
project's data and model pipelines.

This __init__.py file is intentionally left empty. Its presence allows Python
to recognize the 'scripts' directory as a package, which can be useful for
tooling, but it does not export any library code. All reusable business logic
should reside in the `src/` directory.
