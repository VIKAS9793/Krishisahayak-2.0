*Note: Performance may vary in real-world conditions. Always verify critical predictions with agricultural experts.*

## 5. Training Dataset

### Data Composition

The model is trained on a carefully curated hybrid dataset combining:

1. **[PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset)**
   - High-quality lab images
   - Controlled conditions
   - 30,078 images (72% of total)

2. **PlantDoc Dataset**
   - Real-world field conditions
   - Diverse backgrounds and lighting
   - 11,697 images (28% of total)

### Data Validation

All training data undergoes rigorous validation:

1. **File Integrity Check**
   - Validates image existence and integrity
   - Removes corrupt/missing files
   - Standardizes image formats

2. **Label Standardization**
   - Uses `label_map.yaml` for consistent naming
   - Validates all labels against standard set
   - Handles synonyms and variations

3. **Bias Mitigation**
   - Stratified sampling across sources
   - Class-aware data augmentation
   - Source-balanced validation splits

### Preprocessing Pipeline

Managed by `TransformFactory` with:

- **Training Augmentations:**
  - Random resized crops
  - Horizontal/Vertical flips
  - Color jitter
  - Rotation
  - Normalization (ImageNet stats)

- **Validation/Test:**
  - Center crop
  - Resize
  - Normalization

### Data Splits

| Split | Percentage | Samples |
| :--- | :---: | ---: |
| **Training** | 70% | 29,243 |
| **Validation** | 15% | 6,266 |
| **Test** | 15% | 6,266 |

*Splits are stratified by class and data source to ensure representation.*

## 6. Model Details

* **Input Format:** A dictionary of tensors, e.g., `{'rgb': torch.Tensor}`.
* **Output Format:** A dictionary containing the top-k predictions with `class` and `probability`.
* **Inference Time:** `[TODO: Pending performance profiling]`

## 7. Ethical Considerations

### Bias and Fairness

- **Bias Mitigation:**
  - Class weights for handling imbalance
  - Source-aware training
  - Regular bias audits

- **Known Biases:**
  - Better performance on lab vs. field images
  - Geographic bias in training data
  - Limited representation of certain crop varieties

### Explainability

- **Built-in Methods:**
  - Grad-CAM visualization
  - Prediction confidence scores
  - Top-k predictions with reasoning

- **In Development:**
  - SHAP value integration
  - Attention visualization
  - Counterfactual explanations

### Privacy and Security

- **Data Privacy:**
  - Trained on public datasets
  - No personally identifiable information
  - Local processing option available

- **Security:**
  - Model signing
  - Input validation
  - Adversarial attack protection

## 8. Known Limitations

### Technical Limitations

- **Input Sensitivity:**
  - Performance degrades with poor image quality
  - Limited to leaf images (not whole plants)
  - Requires clear view of symptoms

- **Disease Coverage:**
  - 38 plant-disease combinations
  - Limited to common diseases in training data
  - May not detect new or emerging diseases

### Practical Considerations

- **Environmental Factors:**
  - Performance varies with lighting conditions
  - Seasonal variations may affect accuracy
  - Limited testing in all geographic regions

- **Usage Guidelines:**
  - Not a replacement for professional diagnosis
  - Should be used as a decision support tool
  - Regular model updates recommended
