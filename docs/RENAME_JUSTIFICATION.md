## 🔄 Project Renaming Justification: KrishiRakshak → KrishiSahayak

---

## 📌 Background

During the initial phase of the Agritech Hackathon (June 2025), our AI-based agricultural assistant project was submitted under the name:

> **KrishiRakshak** (translated as "Protector of Crops")

Following successful shortlisting in the preliminary round, we undertook due diligence before final submission. This included checking for existing usage, possible IP conflicts, and public search discoverability to avoid confusion with other products or services in the agriculture tech space.

## 🔍 Why We Renamed the Project

### 1. **Risk of Trademark/Brand Conflict**
A web and database review revealed that **"KrishiRakshak"** is:
- Already used in various agricultural schemes, products, and mobile applications in India (including fertilizer labels and agri-cooperative projects).
- Referenced in publicly funded tools under government branding (e.g., "Krishi Rakshak Yojana" and "Krishi Rakshak mobile app").

**Sources**:
- [Krishi Rakshak Google Search](https://www.google.com/search?q=krishi+rakshak)
- [Archived Govt Programs using same name](https://agricoop.nic.in/)
- [Play Store References](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=krishi%20rakshak&c=apps)

⚠️ **Keeping this name may lead to confusion or conflict** with existing market players or public services — which violates the spirit of originality in a hackathon.

### 2. **Alignment with Project's Real Goal**
The new name:
> **KrishiSahayak** (translated as "Agricultural Assistant" or "Helper for Farmers")

This is more accurate and aligned with the actual vision of our solution:
- ✅ Acts as a **supportive guide** to farmers — not just a "protector"
- ✅ Offers **early detection and advisory**, not enforcement or defense
- ✅ Emphasizes **collaboration**, trust, and usability — not just protection

This reframing was essential to reflect our project's **inclusive, assistive, and accessible intent**, especially as we target **rural farmers with limited digital access**.

---

### 3. **Consistency with Hackathon Requirements**
- **We are continuing with the same technical project** that was shortlisted in Phase 1.
- The **rename does not alter**:
  - Our architecture
  - Team composition (solo contributor)
  - Deliverables or goals

> ✅ This change is purely **branding-focused**, with the intention to respect originality, clarity, and real-world application boundaries.

---

## 📁 Project Structure Update

As of June 2025, the project structure has been modernized for clarity and maintainability. All documentation and code references are up to date with the current organization.

## ✅ Final Notes

- All future documentation, presentations, and demo assets now refer to the project as **KrishiSahayak**.
- We believe this change reflects both **professional responsibility** and **user-centered intent**, and hope the judging panel will view it as a proactive and mature choice.

Thank you for understanding.
