"""
KrishiSahayak Integration Tests Package.

This package contains integration tests, which are designed to verify the
interactions between different components of the application.

Unlike unit tests, tests in this suite may require external resources such as a
live database connection, a running API endpoint, or access to cloud services.
They are typically slower and are often run separately from the main unit test suite.
