KrishiSahayak Unit Tests for Utility Modules.

This package contains unit tests for the shared, reusable functions and classes
found in the `krishi_sahayak.utils` module.

Tests here should ensure that general-purpose helpers (e.g., for hardware
detection, logging, or file I/O) function correctly in isolation.
