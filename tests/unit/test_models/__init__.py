"""
KrishiSahayak Unit Tests for Model Architectures and Schemas.

This package contains unit tests for the core components of the
`krishi_sahayak.models` module.

Tests here should verify the correctness of:
- Custom model architectures (e.g., custom `torch.nn.Module` layers).
- Pydantic configuration schemas (e.g., `ModelConfig`, `StreamConfig`).
- Any model-related logic, such as weight initialization or forward pass mechanics,
  tested in isolation with mock data.
