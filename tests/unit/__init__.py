"""
KrishiSahayak Unit Tests Package.

This package contains unit tests, which are designed to verify the correctness
of individual components (e.g., functions, classes) in isolation.

All tests within this suite should be self-contained and must not have external
dependencies such as network access, databases, or file system I/O. Such
dependencies should be "mocked" to ensure tests are fast and deterministic.
